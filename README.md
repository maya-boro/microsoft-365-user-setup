<h2>Creation and Configuration of User Accounts in Microsoft 365</h2>

<p>
First, log into the Microsoft 365 Admin Center using an administrator account. Once logged in, on the left-hand side menu, click on "Users" and select "Active users," then from the Active users list, click on "Add a user." For tutorial purposes, an account will be created for a fictitious user named "Bob Smith," and from the Add a user window, add some basic information for the user account, such as the first and last name, display name, and username, followed by setting up password settings such as automatic password or custom password creation and other related password options. After adding all the basic information, assign product licenses. For tutorial purposes, all available product licenses will be assigned to the fictitious user.

Now, adding optional settings such as admin center access is available. However, for tutorial purposes, the account will be set as a non-administrative user. After, go to the "Review and Finish" section and scroll to the "Profile Info" section and click on the "Edit" button where additional information for the user, such as job title, department, and office information, can be added. For tutorial purposes, the fictitious user will be set up as a financial analyst for the finance department.

<p>
Now go back to the "Review and Finish" section and click on the "Finish Adding" button to allow for the fictitious user account to be created. Once confirmation is received that the fictitious user account has been added to the list of active users, click on the "Close" button.

<p>
Going back to the active user list, the newly created user is listed, and when clicking on the user’s name, an overview of the user account is accessible, along with all the profile information that was added. Devices, licenses, apps, mail, and OneDrive within the user overview can also be managed. Please note that until the user logs into Microsoft 365, devices, mail, or OneDrive cannot be managed.

<p>
To start creating a new group, click on "Teams & Groups," select "Active Teams & Groups," and then from the Active Teams & Groups list, click on the "Add a group" button. First, select a group type; for tutorial purposes, the recommended option will be chosen. Then some basic information about the group, such as a name and description, will need to be added. For tutorial purposes, the group will be a finance group for a fictitious finance department. Assign a group owner (it is required to have at least one group owner); the group owner will have special permissions to manage the group, such as adding or removing members and changing group settings. For tutorial purposes, a previously created fictitious user under the name "Adele Vance" was assigned as a group owner.

<p>
After assigning a group owner(s), add members to the group. For the settings section, a group email address will need to be set up, and the group can be set as public or private. There is also an option to add a Microsoft Teams account to the group. For tutorial purposes, the two fictitious users "Adele Vance" and "Bob Smith" were added to the Finance group, and a finance team email address was created. Now review all the selected options and information added for the group and click the "Create group" button when ready.

Going back to the active teams and groups list, the newly created group is listed, and when clicking on the group’s name, an overview of the group account is accessible, along with all the group information that was added. Membership, channels, and settings within the group overview can also be managed.

<p>
Lastly, log into one of the added group members' Microsoft 365 accounts and log into Outlook. Once in Outlook, right-click on "Folders" and select "Add shared folder"; search for the newly created group name; and select the email address that was created for that group. Once the group email address is added, the user will have access to the shared mailbox for the group. This should be done for every member of the group.
